## Welcome to the CSMHC Forumâ€™s page for our collaborative event, *TPro2 February Event--A Grassroots Perspective: Students Sharing their Experiences on Mental Health*

Join the **[College of Engineering Teaching Professional (TPro2) Group](https://ae3.engineering.illinois.edu/teaching-professionals-program-tpro2/)** for an event on student perspectives and experiences on mental health during COVID-19. The event includes a presentation by the **CS Mental Health Committee** about their new Faculty Mental Health Ambassador Program and resources for how faculty can get basic mental health training as well as tips for implementing more mental health-friendly policies and dialogue in courses.

The presentation will be followed by a student panel and open Q&A. Panelists include:

* **Ananya Cleetus** (*Computer Science*)

* **Neha Prabhu** (*Computer Science*)

* **Melissa Chen** (*Computer Science*)

* **Cora McVey** (*Engineering Physics*)

* **Ali Nunes** (*Materials Science and Engineering*)
