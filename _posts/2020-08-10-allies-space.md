Welcome, dear (potential) ally!

What does it mean to be an ally?

According to the Merriam-Webster dictionary:

```

ally (noun)

al·​ly | \ ˈa-ˌlī, ə-ˈlī \

plural allies

(2) one that is associated with another as a helper: a person or group that provides assistance and support in an ongoing effort, activity, or struggle

```

To be an ally is not only to provide the people around them with the resources they need but also to support them in their time of need. As an ally, it’s important to understand the needs of those with mental health issues. But even more importantly, it’s important to recognize that no ally is perfect because as human beings, it is impossible to perfectly understand someone else and to be perfect in our responses.

Some of the most core tenets of allyship include:

* **Self-awareness**: When one realizes an error and how it might be negatively affecting someone else, the right thing to do is to grow from one’s mistakes.
* **Inclusivity**: People suffering from mental health issues aren’t any less human and should be treated as such. Often, talking about ordinary, everyday-life things can help just as much as a healthy conversation about the challenges they’re facing.
* **Self-care**: Can’t help someone else when you’re hurting yourself! It’s ok to take care of yourself. Don’t let the so-called “superhero complex” take over your life.
